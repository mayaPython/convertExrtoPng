# convertExrtoPng
This is a photoshop action which automates  the conversion of an exr file to a png file (8-bit).

When rendering out 3d elements in Maya the best results for mattes are from an .exr file. 
To use this within a photohsop matte, it is neccessary to convert this to an 8-bit .png file

I created this action to automate the conversion. 

Go to file>automate>batch and change the settings so that the following are ticked:

Override Action "Open" Commands
Include all subfolders
Suppress File Open Options Dialogs
Override Action "Save As" Commands
